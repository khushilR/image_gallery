# image_gallery
It's a Flutter application that displays a gallery of images:
- the images should be displayed as a square grid, the number of columns should depend on the screen width;
- the images should be loaded from Pixabay API;
- the number of likes and views should be displayed under each image;
- when scrolling the gallery downwards new images should be loaded automatically;
